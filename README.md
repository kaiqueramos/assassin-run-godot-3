# Assassin's Run

This is a game made with the Godot 3 Engine & Godot script. It's an infinite runner game where the main character is an assassin who has to run through obstacles. Each obstacle passed grants 1 point to the score. The game has really good animations for the character, and saves the player's last score record.
It's a simple game, but it's made with heart.

## Running the game
Only working for Windows at the moment. Just run the .exe file on the bin folder.
